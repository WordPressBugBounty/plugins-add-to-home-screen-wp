== Installation ==
1. Upload the `add-to-home-screen-wp` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install via the WordPress Plugins dashboard.
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to **Settings > Add to Home Screen** (or **Network Admin > ATHS Network Options** for multisite) to configure settings.
4. For Pro features, install the **Add to Home Screen & PWA Pro** add-on, activate it, and enter your license key in **Settings > License**.

**Multisite Note**: When activated network-wide, settings are managed at the network level and applied to all subsites for a consistent PWA experience. Alternatively, activate it on individual subsites for site-specific customization.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will the floating balloon keep appearing after a user adds my site to their home screen? =
In the free version, the balloon may reappear in Safari unless you set a long expiration time (e.g., 30 days) in the settings. The **Pro version** prevents the balloon from showing once the Web App is installed, ensuring a seamless user experience.

= Why don’t my settings changes appear on my site? =
Try the following:
- Clear your cache if using a caching plugin.
- Clear your browser’s cache and cookies (e.g., in Safari, double-tap the home button, long-press Safari, and close it).
- Ensure settings are saved in the correct context (site-level for single sites, network-level for multisite).

= Can I customize the floating balloon’s message? =
Absolutely! Both free and Pro versions let you craft custom messages with HTML support (e.g., bold, links, emojis) and placeholders like `%site_name`, `%device`, and `%icon`. The Pro version adds dashboard-specific message customization.

= How do I translate custom messages like the floating balloon? =
Custom messages (e.g., floating balloon text) can be translated using WPML’s **String Translation**, Polylang, or Loco Translate. For WPML:
1. Save your messages in **Settings > Add to Home Screen**.
2. Go to **WPML > String Translation**.
3. Search for your message (e.g., "iOS message") or filter by domain `add-to-home-screen-wp`.
4. Add translations for your languages and save.
For Polylang or Loco Translate, use their string translation tools. Check their documentation for details.

= How do I activate Pro features? =
1. Purchase a license at [tulipemedia.com](https://tulipemedia.com/en/product/aths-wordpress-premium/).
2. Install the **Add to Home Screen & PWA Pro** add-on.
3. Enter your license key in **Settings > License** (or **Network Admin > License** for multisite).
4. Configure Pro settings under **Settings > Pro Settings**.

= Does it work with WordPress multisite? =
Yes! The plugin is fully compatible with multisite. When activated network-wide, settings are managed centrally in **Network Admin > ATHS Network Options** and applied to all subsites for a consistent PWA experience. Alternatively, activate it on individual subsites for site-specific customization. The Pro version extends this with network-level premium features.

= What happens when I uninstall the plugin? =
Both free and Pro versions offer a clean uninstall option. Enable **Delete Data on Uninstall** in **Settings > Add to Home Screen** to remove all plugin data. Uncheck it to preserve settings for reinstallation.
